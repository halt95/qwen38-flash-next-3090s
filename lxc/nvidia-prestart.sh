# Proxmox VE hookscript for the Flash-Next container (lxc/pve-create.sh): create the NVIDIA device nodes on the HOST
# before the container starts. After a host reboot the /dev/nvidia* nodes (the uvm ones in particular) do not exist
# until something opens the driver, and `pct start` then fails on the missing device passthrough.
#
# Proxmox calls a hookscript as `<script> <vmid> <phase>`, phase = pre-start | post-start | pre-stop | post-stop;
# a non-zero exit in pre-start aborts the start. Install on the Proxmox host (the storage must have the Snippets
# content type enabled, and the script must be executable):
#
#   install -m 0755 lxc/nvidia-prestart.sh /var/lib/vz/snippets/nvidia-prestart.sh
#   pct set <CTID> --hookscript local:snippets/nvidia-prestart.sh
